# Meow?

I just wanted to share one of my **favourite** screen shots of the game *FFVII:rebirth*.

* Two of my favourite characters just being silly goofy.

## Vincent & Reeve (a.k.a. Cait Sith)

### From *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*

Vincent never asked to be part of this circus.

Wrapped in crimson and silence, he was used to shadows—used to regret, and to ghosts that clung tighter than armor. And yet, here he was, being dragged into chaos by a talking cat with a crown.

Cait Sith, or Reeve—depending on the moment—chuckled as he peeked at the device in Vincent’s gloved hand.

> "C’mon, Vince! Lighten up, will ya? It’s not every day we get to break into a Shinra vault with style."

Vincent said nothing. He rarely did. But the flick of his eyes said enough: *Just tell me the plan.*

They were opposites in every sense—one a stoic relic of war, the other a motor-mouthed projection with too much flair and not enough fear. And yet, somehow, they worked.

The mission ahead was dangerous, sure. But Vincent had survived worse. And while he wouldn’t admit it, maybe having a loudmouth cat by his side made the silence a little less unbearable.

Just maybe.

Absolutely! Here's a **Cait Sith–narrated version** of the story, packed with his signature flair:

## Cait Sith’s Big Day Out

### (With Vincent Valentine, Professional Brooder)

Look, I’ve worked with all kinds—heroes, mercs, talking flowers once (long story)—but Vincent? He’s in a *league* of his own. Silent. Mysterious. Dressed like a vampire librarian with vengeance issues. But don’t let that trench coat fool you—deep down, he’s got the heart of a tragic poet. Or a cactus. Still deciding.

So there we are, deep underground, about to crack into some old Shinra tech. I'm perched on his shoulder, of course—because where else would I be? I’ve got the crown, the charm, the brain, and the best seat in the house.

> “Vinny,” I say, “You sure this is the right place? Because it smells like chocobo feet and regret.”

He doesn’t answer. Classic. But that little flick of his red eyes tells me we’re close. I peek over at the device he’s holding—some weird prototype Reeve swiped from an old Turk archive. Lights blink. Beeps happen. Suspense builds.

> “Ooooh, I love a good heist!”

Still nothing from Vincent. Man of few words, that one. But that’s alright. I talk enough for two.

And just as the lock clicks open and a rush of stale air bursts out from the hidden vault, I can *feel* it—this is gonna be big. Shinra secrets. Forgotten power. Maybe even snacks.

Vincent sighs. I swear it’s a sigh. Maybe.

> “Let’s go,” he mutters.

I grin.

> “After you, spooky.”
