# 💻 How Code Becomes a Website

## *(Using this project as an example)*

Think of a website like a school play.

There’s a **script** (what to say), **set design** (what it looks like), and a **director** (what happens and when). Code works the same way — it gives instructions to the computer to **render** (or display) a website that people can see and use.

## 🧱 1. HTML = The Structure

HTML is like the **stage and script**. It lays out what should appear on the page — like a title, photo, or button.

When your browser loads a website, it reads the HTML and says:
> “Okay, I need to show a heading, some images, and a few buttons.”

## 🎨 2. CSS = The Design

CSS is like the **costumes and decorations**. It tells the browser how to make everything *look* — colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

For example:  
HTML says "put a button here," and CSS says, "make it red, with rounded corners, and center it."

## 🧠 3. JavaScript = The Brains

JavaScript adds the **interactions and behavior** — like when you click a button and a new page appears, or when the site loads content automatically.

It’s like the **director** giving cues:
> “When someone clicks this, make that show up.”

## 🔄 What Does the Browser Actually Do?

When you open a website, your browser (like Chrome or Safari) goes through these steps:

1. **Reads the HTML** to understand what to show.
2. **Applies the CSS** to style it.
3. **Runs the JavaScript** to add any interactive stuff.
4. **Renders** the page — which means it turns all those instructions into the visual website you see and use.

## 🛠️ When You're Building a Website

With a project like this one:

- You run a **local server** on your computer — like a mini, private version of the internet.
- Your browser reads the files (HTML, CSS, JS), **renders the website**, and shows it to you.
- As you make changes, the page updates automatically so you can test and tweak things.

## 🚀 When It’s Ready for the Internet

Once the website is finished, it gets **published** — uploaded to a web host so everyone can visit it.

Now, whenever someone visits the site:

- Their browser **downloads the code**
- **Renders** the webpage just like before
- And they see exactly what you built
