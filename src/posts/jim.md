# Jim

## From *Silent Hill 2*

I just finished *Silent Hill 2*, and I can't stop thinking about that final moment. The silence. The darkness. That hole.

Jim—James Sunderland, really—stood at the edge of something more than a literal pit. He stood at the brink of his own guilt, a man unraveling, trying to grasp at pieces of a life that had long since slipped away. The puzzles, the twisted corridors, the faceless monsters—they weren’t just scares. They were echoes of a broken mind.

The moment I saw him staring into that endless hole, flashlight trembling in the damp rot of the walls, I knew I’d reached a point of no return—not just in the game, but in understanding who James really was. What he’d done. What Silent Hill wanted him to face.

That hole wasn’t just in the ground.

It was inside him.

And somehow, even knowing that, I still jumped in.
