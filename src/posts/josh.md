## Josh

### From *Final Fantasy XVI*

I just started *Final Fantasy XVI*, and Josh instantly pulled at my heart.

There’s something about his quiet strength—how he carries the weight of the world behind that calm gaze, all while wrapped in crimson and fate. Watching him stand beside Clive, both of them hardened by the fire of war and loss, reminded me this isn't just a fantasy. It’s a tragedy written in steel and sacrifice.

Josh doesn’t yell. He doesn’t have to. His resolve speaks volumes—especially when you know what he’s already given up. There's sorrow in his silence and hope in his loyalty. And when he finally takes a stand, you feel it.

Every. Single. Word.

This isn’t just a game about crystals and kingdoms. It’s about brothers—by blood or bond—and how far they’ll go to protect the future they still believe in.

Josh, you’re more than a phoenix. You’re the reason I keep playing.
